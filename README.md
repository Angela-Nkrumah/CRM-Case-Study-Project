# CRM-Case-Study-Project
This project created an automated brand performance monitoring system for a multi-brand fashion company. By analyzing key metrics—Return Percentage, Ad Spend ROI, and Average Order Value—the solution classifies each brand into four actionable stages: Loyalty, Ad Spend Inefficient, Retention Risk, or Healthy. A Power BI dashboard provides a single view of brand growth and performance trends, while an automated Zapier alert instantly notifies the team when a brand falls into the "Retention Risk" category, enabling rapid intervention.
